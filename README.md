# Indicator-Control-System-
This project implements an automotive-style indicator control system using Arduino and Simulink, featuring Left, Right, and Hazard light functionality.  It simulates real-world turn signal behavior with logic-based control using physical push buttons, PWM-based LED blinking, and long-press detection.
